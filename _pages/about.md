I received my PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Paul Goulart](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~engs1373/) in the control group of Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford. My current research is on numerical algorithms for convex conic optimization, from the design of efficient first-order methods and interior point methods and their implementation on GPU. Before joining University of Oxford, I obtained my bachelor degree from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Shanghai Jiao Tong University (2017) and master degree from the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering of ETH Zurich (2020).
